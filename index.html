              — Ring Lardner </p>
            <h2 style="border-bottom: 2px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);">Scientific Reason About Love</h2>
                <p>Love’s warm squishiness seems a thing far removed from the cold, hard reality of science. Yet the two do meet, whether in lab tests for surging hormones or in austere chambers where MRI scanners noisily thunk and peer into brains that ignite at glimpses of their soulmates.</p>
                <p>When it comes to thinking deeply about love, poets, philosophers, and even high school boys gazing dreamily at girls two rows over have a significant head start on science. But the field is gamely racing to catch up.</p>
                <p>One database of scientific publications turns up more than 6,600 pages of results in a search for the word “love.” The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting 18 clinical trials on it (though, like love itself, NIH’s “love” can have layered meanings, including as an acronym for a study of Crohn’s disease). Though not normally considered an intestinal ailment, love is often described as an illness, and the smitten as lovesick. Comedian George Burns once described love as something like a backache: “It doesn’t show up on X-rays, but you know it’s there.”</p>
                <p>Love also turns on the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is known to stimulate the brain’s pleasure centers. Couple that with a drop in levels of serotonin — which adds a dash of obsession — and you have the crazy, pleasing, stupefied, urgent love of infatuation.</p>
                <p>It’s also true, Schwartz said, that like the moon — a trigger of its own legendary form of madness — love has its phases.</p>
                <p>“It’s fairly complex, and we only know a little about it,” Schwartz said. “There are different phases and moods of love. The early phase of love is quite different” from later phases.</p>
                <p>During the first love-year, serotonin levels gradually return to normal, and the “stupid” and “obsessive” aspects of the condition moderate. That period is followed by increases in the hormone oxytocin, a neurotransmitter associated with a calmer, more mature form of love. The oxytocin helps cement bonds, raise immune function, and begin to confer the health benefits found in married couples, who tend to live longer, have fewer strokes and heart attacks, be less depressed, and have higher survival rates from major surgery and cancer.</p>

            <h2 style="border-bottom: 2px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);">More knowledge, but struggling to understand</h2>
                <p>The concept of love has been studied throughout history. Philosophers have been asking
                  such questions as “What is love?” and “Why do we love?” since the beginning of time. Today,
                  these questions are still being asked, perhaps in a more desperate way. When children are very
                  young, they are read fairy tales about Prince Charming rescuing a helpless princess, with the two
                  of them riding off into the sunset to live the seemingly “happily ever after”. However, the
                  “happily ever after” is never fully described. Do the prince and the princess get married, have
                  children, and grow old together? Or do they in fact get married, have children, and then fall out
                  of “love” and end up divorced within a few years? Do they stay happily and passionately in
                  love, or do they stay together only out of the fear of loneliness? While the rates do seem to be
                  leveling out, the trend remains that a high number of all marriages do ultimately end in divorce.
                  The Americans for Divorce Reform currently estimates that "Probably, 40 or possibly even 50
                  percent of marriages will end in divorce if current trends continue." The question then becomes
                  not only “What is love?”, but “What is love, and why are some people able to stay together,
                  while other relationships fall apart?”</p>
                <p>Plato’s discussion of the idea of a “soul mate” is crucial to today’s idea of love.
                  We spend a considerable amount of time searching for our soul mates; some of us spend our
                  entire lives, just to feel the type of love that Plato described. </p>
                <p>“I think we know a lot more scientifically about love and the brain than we did a couple of decades ago, but I don’t think it tells us very much that we didn’t already know about love,” Schwartz said. “It’s kind of interesting, it’s kind of fun [to study]. But do we think that makes us better at love, or helping people with love? Probably not much.”</p>
                <p>When we are falling in love, chemicals associated with the reward circuit flood our brain, producing a variety of physical and emotional responses—racing hearts, sweaty palms, flushed cheeks, feelings of passion and anxiety.</p>

              <h3 style="color: rgb(126, 33, 33);" class="article-title" onclick="toggleArticle(event)">Still in love with you</h3>
              <div class="article-content">
                  <p>While research on this specific topic is quite thin, we can speculate the real reason by looking at what we know about what our brains experience when we fall in love. The first time you fell in love, your brain experienced all the things mentioned above (increases in positive hormones, decreases in negative hormones).</p>
                  <p>Jefferson Singer, a psychologist who focuses on autobiographical memory, says that most people experience a “memory bump” between the ages of 15 and 26. This memory bump happens at a time when we are experiencing all kinds of firsts (driving a car, having sex, falling in love, etc.). Later in life, these memories tend to be more impactful because they occurred when our memory was at its peak.</p>
                  <p>“We have the opportunity to rehearse it and replay it, rethink it, reimagine it, re-experience it,” says Singer.</p>
                  <p>There is still be much research to be done on the true effects of love on the human brain, but from what we understand so far, love doesn’t just affect us while we experience it. Its impact on our biology can be felt for the rest of our lives, and the power of this phenomenon can be difficult to explain and understand, as Albert Einstein once put it: “How on earth are you going to explain in terms of chemistry and physics so important a biological phenomenon as first love?”</p>

              <div class="article-content">
                  <p>Some physicists believe in a flatter version of multiple universes. That is, if the universe that we live in goes on forever, there are only so many ways that the building blocks of matter can arrange themselves as they assemble across infinite space. Eventually, any finite number of particle types must repeat a particular arrangement. Hypothetically, in a big enough space, those particles must repeat arrangements as large as entire solar systems and galaxies.</p>
                  <p>So, your entire life might be repeated elsewhere in the universe, down to what you ate for breakfast yesterday. At least, that's the theory.</p>
                  <p style="font-style: italic;">“Maybe we were together in another life...in a parallel universe, maybe our paths are not supposed to cross twice, maybe your arms are not supposed to go around me. I hear about you now & then, I wonder where you are & how you feel. Sometimes I walk by & I look up to your balcony, just to make sure you were real-just to make sure that I can still feel you...it appears to me that Destiny Rules...”</p>
